# Opinion-Polling
My attempt at graphing various opinion polls from around the world!


So far I have graphed:

* Polls for the next UK General Election
  - Voting history of Harborough Constituency since 1885
  - Voting history of Leicester Easte Constituency since 1918
* Polls for the next Turkish Presidential Election
* Seat projections for the next Polish Parliamentary Election
* Polls for the next Slovak Parliamentary Election
* Polls for the various Spanish Regional Elections
* Graph of the US Speakers votes because it is funny
