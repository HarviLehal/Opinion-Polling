# Opinion-Polling
My attempt at graphing opinion polls since the last general election
Data extracted by by scraping Wikipedia tables instead of manually doing it by hand as previously done (apologies to my supervisors if they see that I was doing this!!!)

By Running the code in Poll.R, not only will you recieve a lovely neat .csv file of all polling data in the UK since January 1st 2020, you will also produce fabulous BBC-Style Graphs!
